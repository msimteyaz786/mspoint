            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>C is a general-purpose procedure-oriented programming language developed by Dennis Ritchi in 1972 at Bell Telephone Laboratories. C is a middle-level language as it has features of both high-level language and low-level language. Previous language BCPL and B form which C is evolved are 'types-less' language, C intoduced the concept of features.</p>

                <p><b>Operating Systems:</b><br>
                Unix OS is entirely written in C, and the Linux OS kernal is written in C with some protion developed in assembly.<br><br>
                <b>Mobile OS:</b><br>
                The kernal of world's most popular mobile Operating System Android is also having a part written in C.<br><br>
                <b>Databases:</b><br>
                The world's most popular database, including Oracle Database, MySQL, etc, are coded in C along with C++.<br><br>
                <b>Programming Language:</b><br>
                Many modern programming language including C++, Java, C#, Python, Ruby, PHP, etc., are influenced by the C language and have their implementations written in C.
