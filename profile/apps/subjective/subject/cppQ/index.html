            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p> C++ is an Object-Oriented Programming Language. It was developed by         <b> Bjarne Stroustrup</b> in 1990. <BR></BR>
                    Bjarne Stroustrup wants to develop a language that support object-oriented programming features with the powerful features of C language, and hence C++ evolved. <br><br>
                    C++ consists of C language features along with class-object construct features of Simula67. <br><br>
                    Initially C++ is named as <b>C with Classes</b> by <b>Bjarne Stroustrup</b> but in 1983, it was renamed to C++ (indicating an increment to C) proposed by <b>Rrick Mascitti.</b> <br><br>
                    It is a superset of C language, while C++ contains features of C language and adds some of its own. Almost all programs written in C are also C++ programs. <br><br>
                    C++ programming language provide many essential features including polymorphism, virtual and friend functions, templates, namespaces and operator overloading etc.

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p><b>Game Engines:</b><br>
                C++ is one of the best at the field of game development and mnany game engines including Visual Pinsual Pinball, Frosbite, REDengine, shiVa and mant more are developed using C++.<br><br>
                <b>GUI Based Application:</b><br>
                Most of the Adobe Application including Illustrator, Photoshop etc. are developed in C++. Windows media player is alos developed using C++.<br><br>
                <b>Browsers:</b><br>
                Mozila Firefox is developed in C++. Also Googles's Chrome Browsers have same part written in C++.<br><br>
                <b>Database:</b><br>
                 The world's most popular database Oracle Database, MySQL, etc. are coded in C++ along with C language. <br><br>
                 <b>Operating System:</b><br>
                 Most of the Windows Operating System have three huge portion written in C++ (along with Visual C++) some part of Apple Operating System is also coded in C++. <br><br>
                 <b>Programming Language:</b><br>
                 Many modern programming language including C#, D, Java, PHP, Python, Limbo etc, are influenced by the C++ language and have their initial and partial implementations written in C++.<br><br>

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p><b>Simple:</b><br>
                C++ is simpler to understand as the syntax is almost similar to the C language with very little changes.<br><br>

                <b>Portable Language:</b><br>
                C++ is a protable language. It means that C++ programs for written for a computing environment can easily run on another comupter having the same environment.<br><br>
                <b>Object-Oriented:</b><br>
                It follows the concept of OOPs like, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Eccapsulation, Abstraction. This makes development and maintenance easier.</b><br><br>
                
                 <b>Operating System:</b><br>
                 Most of the Windows Operating System have three huge portion written in C++ (along with Visual C++) some part of Apple Operating System is also coded in C++. <br><br>
                 <b>Better Memory Management:</b><br>
                 C++ Privide Batter Memory Management. It support dunamic memory allocation and we can allocate and deallocate the allocated memory at any time whenever needed. <br><br>

                <p>
                    → C++ provides data security but it is not up to the mark, hence are security issues with the C++. <br><br>
                    → Exception handing mechanism providing by C++ is not that much reliable. <br><br>
                    → C++ does not provide automatic memory Management mechanism. <br><br>
                    → C++ does not provide built-in multi-threading machanism.

            <div class="accordion-content">
                <p>POP stands for 'Procedure-oriented Programming language'. That is programming language in which a list of instructions is given to the computer to follow, in order to perform a task. These instructions are organized into groups which are known as functions(procedures). BASIC, BCPL, C COBOL etc all are Procedure-oriented programming language.</p>
